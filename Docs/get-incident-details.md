## Demo Request and Response 
The ontraForce API allows you to test the call quickly using demo endpoints. 
In the development environment you can use demo endpoints so the parameters passed won't be vaildated and you will be retrieving a valid response with sample data even if there is no data. This should make your development experience faster and smoother overall. 

> The demo request also requires an API Key, but any parameters passed will be ignored in the result, as you will always get the same result. 

``` HTTP
GET /api/beta/partners/demo/incidents/[RANOM_ID]/details?
```
