## Multi-Tenancy in ContraForce
Through the ContraForce Partner Program, partners can create ContraForce environments for their customers and then manage their incidents and connected data sources within ContraForce web application. The ContraForce API allows users to retrieve portal data via API calls in addition to web application user interface.

![ContraForce Multi-Tenancy Diagram](https://github.com/ContraForce/contraforce-api/blob/main/Images/Multi-Tenancy%20Flow%20for%20Partners.drawio.svg?raw=true)

ContraForce environments are created per customer. Because of this, a **Tenant ID** is a mandatory parameter for any ContraForce API request. By sepcifying the Tenant ID in the request body, partners are enabled to access data from any of the customer ContraForce environments under their management.

## Authentication for the ContraForce API
In the current version of the ContraForce API, the exposed endpoints of the API are secured using an ***API Key***. An API key can be requested after Partner Onboarding has been completed. A member of the ContraForce Engineering team will provide you with an API key and assist you with the connection process.

The generated API key must be sent in the header of each HTTP request you are making to the ContraForce API as shown below for a C# example: 
``` C#
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
	// Set your API key in the header of the HTTP request
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY");
	
	// Submit the request and the rest of the logic
	...
}
```
If you are testing the API calls using **Postman**, you can set the API key as shown below:

## Testing the ContraForce API
After you obtain an API key, you can send a test request to ensure that the ContraForce API is functioning as intended.

```
After you submit the test request, a sucess response should appear as shown below.
``` JSON
{
	"message": "Welcome to the ContraForce API"
}
```
